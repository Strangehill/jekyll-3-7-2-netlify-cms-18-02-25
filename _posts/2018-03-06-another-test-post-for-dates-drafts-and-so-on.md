title: 'another test post for dates, drafts, and so on'

I tested a post previously that triggered an error-free deploy but did not result in a blog post. This blog post I'm creating under very likely very similar conditions. That previous post since been rendered to the site. I expect this test post to not render in the immediate minutes after deploying. I suspect it's got something to do with the filename of the post indicating a date that is a future date relative to the date used by the 'build and deploy' netlify process.
